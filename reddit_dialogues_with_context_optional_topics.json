They hit her as she was trying to stop them while she was screaming there was a child inside. No...these people WERE NOT immigrants.\n\nBut now...because of baseless lies about immigrants, DeWine has had to pull police resources (while at the same time police bemoan the lack of manpower) away from dealing with real criminals committing real crimes...to sweep schools and other public spaces due to bomb threats based solely on the fevered hateful imaginations of JDVance and his running mate.\n\nThis BS hurts everyone...the legal immigrants, the people of Springfield, and the people of Ohio,who all deserve better!"

            "text": ">I bolted out of the press gallery hoping to find out whether Pence just needed a bathroom break from the tedious proceedings. I bounded down the stairs to the second floor, where senators enter and exit the Chamber. Then I heard it: Police clashing with rioters yet another floor below. I could hear a loud thwacking sound \u2014 possibly a billy club being wielded against the invaders.\n\n>I retreated back up to the third-floor press gallery in time to see Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) finish defending her state\u2019s electoral count for Biden. Then Capitol Police and staff ordered everyone into the Senate Chamber.\n\n>For our own safety.\n\n>I was ordered into a gallery that is reserved for family and close friends of senators \u2014 Rep. Greg Pence (R-Ind.), the vice president\u2019s brother, had just been there watching the proceedings. But I climbed over several rails and chairs to get back to the usual press location, directly above where Pence had been sitting as the presiding officer.\n\n>Soon, the Senate was sealed off and the session was adjourned. Capitol Police raced around the two-story Senate Chamber locking every set of doors.\n\n>Then Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) looked at her phone and announced: \u201cShots fired.\u201d\n\n>A veteran Capitol Police officer tried to calm the senators, telling them the report might not be accurate. But at 2:30 p.m., police ordered everyone out. ...\n\n>We were not allowed to take the stairs, because the mob was on the floors below. So into the elevators and down to the basement we went, racing toward the Capitol Visitor Center. The CVC is a vast underground bunker of a structure that finally got built after 9/11. It cost roughly $700 million and has multiple secure rooms and blast-resistant doors.\n\n>An officer, holding back two doors, ordered us to head toward the Russell Senate Office Building because the pro-Trump mob had also breached the CVC.\n\n$700 million, multiple secure rooms, blast-resistant doors, and the first place they take congressmen in the event of an emergency is breached immediately and rendered useless.\n\n>Some senators ran; some walked. Security guards held Schumer by the shoulders to whisk him along. ...\n\n>By 2:45 p.m. most senators and a collection of aides and media had gathered in the secure room. An officer informed us that we were safe but said it would take a while to secure the complex. In the meantime, they said they were trying to find buses to get us to safer ground.\n\n>Back in the Capitol, police began a room-by-room search to find senators, staff and reporters who had been left behind. One senior GOP aide, who has an office not far from the Senate floor, said he took a steel rod and barricaded his door when the pro-Trump mob approached. For what seemed like 20 minutes, he said, rioters banged on his door, trying to break in. ...\n\n>Inside the Senate\u2019s secure location, one senior officer ordered a set of underlings to go secure Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a double amputee who lost both legs while serving in the Iraq War. She was hiding in her office three floors above, fearful of letting anyone in. The senior officer gave specific instructions of what to yell: \u201cSenator Duckworth, Senator Klobuchar said come to the door.\u201d\n\n>A few minutes later, she appeared in the secure spot.\n\nJesus.\n\n>Somehow, Capitol food service operations still appeared to be up and running through the melee. At 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., hundreds of box lunches and bottles of water were rolled into the holding spot. Senators, staff, media and police wielding automatic weapons grabbed lunches of chicken and beef.\n\n>Eventually, reporters were herded out of the main secure room and into an outside lobby. Senators stayed behind, and began discussing what had gone wrong with the basic fabric of American democracy. Televisions were wheeled into the senators-only room so they could watch the chaos unfold for themselves.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/reporter-senate-evacuated/2021/01/06/3e7d5456-5061-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html"

[The NYTimes has a really helpful chart that explains what to expect in each state.](https://nyti.ms/369bnhp) \n\n> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states were not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania did not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day and may not finish counting them all until November 6th. Keep in mind that we've had historically high numbers of mail-in ballots this year, and counting them all takes time due to the robust security measures in place. \n\n> To dig into this even more, we can look at Michigan and Pennsylvania: \n\n> * Michigan - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 10% of votes are left to count, and Biden has a small lead. The bulk of the remaining ballots are in Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, but the clerk there has not (yet) given a timeframe for when we can expect results. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is promising a \"much more complete picture of Michigan by the end of the day\".\n\n> * Pennsylvania - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 22% of votes are left to count. We are unlikely to know the final count today because 1) Philadelphia, its suburbs, and Pittsburgh are still counting ballots, and 2) ballots can still arrive by Friday if postmarked on Election Day (though this is likely to be challenged at the Supreme Court). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **But we've never had an election where ballots weren't all counted on election night!**\n\n> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available by the end of the week. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**\n\n> FALSE. Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't \"stealing\" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What's the deal with Pennsylvania?

You can read a really detailed explanation [here.](https://53eig.ht/2TKgBu4)\n\n> Here's what's happening: Pennsylvania counted the in-person Election Day vote first and that vote favored President Trump, as expected. Mail-in ballots are counted later, and are expected to favor Biden. This is why we saw Trump with a big lead on election night and a shrinking lead as of this morning. You should expect to continue to see this shrink.\n\n> Simply put: We need to wait for all the votes to be counted before calling the winner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What about Arizona?**\n\n> Arizona is interesting because it could actually experience a \"red shift\". Early votes were expected to favor Biden, and over the course of the night, the race has tightened. While some media outlets have called Arizona for Biden, we should keep an eye on it.\n\n> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**\n\n> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure.

[The NYTimes has a really helpful chart that explains what to expect in each state.](https://nyti.ms/369bnhp) \n\n> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states were not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania did not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day and may not finish counting them all until November 6th. Keep in mind that we've had historically high numbers of mail-in ballots this year, and counting them all takes time due to the robust security measures in place. \n\n> To dig into this even more, we can look at Michigan and Pennsylvania: \n\n> * Michigan - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 10% of votes are left to count, and Biden has a small lead. The bulk of the remaining ballots are in Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, but the clerk there has not (yet) given a timeframe for when we can expect results. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is promising a \"much more complete picture of Michigan by the end of the day\".\n\n> * Pennsylvania - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 22% of votes are left to count. We are unlikely to know the final count today because 1) Philadelphia, its suburbs, and Pittsburgh are still counting ballots, and 2) ballots can still arrive by Friday if postmarked on Election Day (though this is likely to be challenged at the Supreme Court). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **But we've never had an election where ballots weren't all counted on election night!**\n\n> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available by the end of the week. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**\n\n> FALSE. Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't \"stealing\" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What's the deal with Pennsylvania? Why are so many people alarmed?**\n\n> Experts anticipated a \"red mirage\" in Pennsylvania that would later be subject to a \"blue shift\" -- and it looks like that's what we're seeing right now. You can read a really detailed explanation [here.](https://53eig.ht/2TKgBu4)\n\n> Here's what's happening: Pennsylvania counted the in-person Election Day vote first and that vote favored President Trump, as expected. Mail-in ballots are counted later, and are expected to favor Biden. This is why we saw Trump with a big lead on election night and a shrinking lead as of this morning. You should expect to continue to see this shrink.\n\n> Simply put: We need to wait for all the votes to be counted before calling the winner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What about Arizona?**\n\n> Arizona is interesting because it could actually experience a \"red shift\". Early votes were expected to favor Biden, and over the course of the night, the race has tightened. While some media outlets have called Arizona for Biden, we should keep an eye on it.\n\n> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**\n\n> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure.

Keep in mind that we've had historically high numbers of mail-in ballots this year, and counting them all takes time due to the robust security measures in place. \n\n> To dig into this even more, we can look at Michigan and Pennsylvania: \n\n> * Michigan - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 10% of votes are left to count, and Biden has a small lead.

[The NYTimes has a really helpful chart that explains what to expect in each state.](https://nyti.ms/369bnhp) \n\n> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states were not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania did not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day and may not finish counting them all until November 6th. Keep in mind that we've had historically high numbers of mail-in ballots this year, and counting them all takes time due to the robust security measures in place. \n\n> To dig into this even more, we can look at Michigan and Pennsylvania: \n\n> * Michigan - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 10% of votes are left to count, and Biden has a small lead. The bulk of the remaining ballots are in Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, but the clerk there has not (yet) given a timeframe for when we can expect results. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is promising a \"much more complete picture of Michigan by the end of the day\".\n\n> * Pennsylvania - As of 10:30am ET on 11/4, 22% of votes are left to count. We are unlikely to know the final count today because 1) Philadelphia, its suburbs, and Pittsburgh are still counting ballots, and 2) ballots can still arrive by Friday if postmarked on Election Day (though this is likely to be challenged at the Supreme Court). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **But we've never had an election where ballots weren't all counted on election night!**\n\n> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available by the end of the week. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**\n\n> FALSE. Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't \"stealing\" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What's the deal with Pennsylvania? Why are so many people alarmed?**\n\n> Experts anticipated a \"red mirage\" in Pennsylvania that would later be subject to a \"blue shift\" -- and it looks like that's what we're seeing right now. You can read a really detailed explanation [here.](https://53eig.ht/2TKgBu4)\n\n> Here's what's happening: Pennsylvania counted the in-person Election Day vote first and that vote favored President Trump, as expected. Mail-in ballots are counted later, and are expected to favor Biden. This is why we saw Trump with a big lead on election night and a shrinking lead as of this morning. You should expect to continue to see this shrink.\n\n> Simply put: We need to wait for all the votes to be counted before calling the winner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **What about Arizona?**\n\n> Arizona is interesting because it could actually experience a \"red shift\". Early votes were expected to favor Biden, and over the course of the night, the race has tightened. While some media outlets have called Arizona for Biden, we should keep an eye on it.\n\n> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**\n\n> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure. Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the most secure elections in the country.

Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n* **Where can I find the official election results?**\n\n> The only official results are those certified by state elections officials.

Around the same time that news broke, he was on an interview talking about abortion and vaguely said something like the kid will be born and kept comfortable and then doctors will decide. Well, Trump is saying Democrats want to kill born babies after this almost 2 year old incident, when in fact many Democrats were demanding he resign from office, among those were you guessed it, Biden and Harris.\n\nTrump is digging up years old issues to try and get any fodder on Biden because he knows his base won't do the due diligence to actually understand what he's rambling about.

Why even try?\u201d The president\u2019s staff, this person said, have no ability to think strategically because the president\u2019s behavior poses new threats to survival every five minutes. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re even considering what happens if he\u2019s back in the White House and he needs oxygen or a ventilator. Their view is \u2018If it happens, well, we\u2019ll fucking figure it out when it happens!\u2019\u2009\u201d*  \n   \n*As he considers the end, he fakes his way through a performance of political possibility. One person who publicly supports Trump and considers him a friend said that, in conversations with White House and campaign officials following the president\u2019s release from the hospital, it became clear that no one who was supposed to know seemed sure when he would be okay. \u201cThey\u2019re putting out a big \u2018Oh, everything\u2019s fine!\u2019 face. But I don\u2019t think they know how much stamina he\u2019s gonna have,\u201d this person said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he looked on that balcony.

Apparently last Saturday Trump said he was worried he might die, even as his doctor was telling everyone he was absolutely fine.  \n\nFrom one of the best connected and most consistently accurate journalists in Washington (as far as I've seen).  \n\n*A second former White House official said the problem is \u201cnow people are so broken down, to the point where everyone\u2019s been in \u2018Jesus, take the wheel\u2019 mode for the last couple years, and fighting against him is only gonna get them burned. Why even try?\u201d The president\u2019s staff, this person said, have no ability to think strategically because the president\u2019s behavior poses new threats to survival every five minutes. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re even considering what happens if he\u2019s back in the White House and he needs oxygen or a ventilator. Their view is \u2018If it happens, well, we\u2019ll fucking figure it out when it happens!\u2019\u2009\u201d*  \n   \n*As he considers the end, he fakes his way through a performance of political possibility. One person who publicly supports Trump and considers him a friend said that, in conversations with White House and campaign officials following the president\u2019s release from the hospital, it became clear that no one who was supposed to know seemed sure when he would be okay. \u201cThey\u2019re putting out a big \u2018Oh, everything\u2019s fine!\u2019 face. But I don\u2019t think they know how much stamina he\u2019s gonna have,\u201d this person said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he looked on that balcony. Last week, I would\u2019ve said that he was definitely going to win. Now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d*  \n\nREAD IT.  \n \nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/10/donald-trump-covid-19-white-house.html"

The DoJ has said nothing about it either, not a denial of illness, or a report of testing, or anything.\n\nThis man, much more than Trump himself, is ground zero for all the ratfucking we all expect to happen.
